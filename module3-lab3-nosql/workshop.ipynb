    "# Workshop Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to this instructional workshop focused on NoSQL database manipulation using Python. The primary objective of this workshop is to impart practical skills in database operations such as querying and inserting data. A secondary goal is to offer participants a tangible experience with a document-oriented database, simulating interactions commonly found in more advanced databases like MongoDB.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction to TinyDB\n",
    "\n",
    "In this workshop we will be using [TinyDB](https://tinydb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) - a minimalistic, document-oriented database.  It was designed for ease of use and quick deployment, making it an ideal choice for Python developers interested in rapid development and prototyping. Its pure Python implementation negates the need for external dependencies, making it easy to setup and use right away.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it is crucial to understand the limitations of TinyDB. As an embedded database, it lacks the performance optimization, scalability, and feature-rich nature of server-based solutions such as [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/). While it is efficient for small, standalone applications (like this workshop), TinyDB is not designed for high-throughput, data-intensive, or multi-user environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rationale for Using TinyDB\n",
    "\n",
    "TinyDB's embedded nature obviates the need for a separate, cumbersome installation process, thereby making it highly accessible and minimizing the potential for technical complications. This is especially useful in educational settings where participants may not have administrative privileges on their computing systems. Furthermore, despite its limitations, TinyDB serves as an excellent introduction to document databases, providing an opportunity to grasp essential concepts and operations in a simplified environment."

    "# Workshop Setup: Initialization and Database Connection\n",
    "\n",
    "Before diving into the specifics of database operations, let's establish the basic environment required for this workshop. This involves two key steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Importing the Necessary Objects**: The TinyDB library provides various objects that facilitate database interactions. For this workshop, we'll specifically need **`TinyDB`** for database operations and **`Query`** for building search queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Creating a Database Handle**: A handle (sometimes referred to as a database connection) is essentially a variable through which we can interact with the database. We'll call various methods on this handle to execute operations like insert, delete, and query.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Workshop Database\n",
    "\n",
    "For this workshop, we have already provided you with a pre-populated database file named `movies.json` containing JSON documents for 32,000+ movies dating back to the early 1900s. Your first task is simply to connect to this existing database. No need for complicated setups or installations!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Initialization Code\n",
    "\n",
    "The next cell contains the following code. Let's dissect what these statements do.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from tinydb import TinyDB, Query  # Imports the required objects\n",
    "db = TinyDB('movies.json')        # Creates a handle (connection) to the existing database file 'movies.json'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### What's Happening Here?\n",
    "\n",
    "- `from tinydb import TinyDB, Query`: This line imports the `TinyDB` and `Query` objects from the TinyDB library. These objects contain methods that allow us to perform operations on our database.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `db = TinyDB('movies.json')`: Here, we're creating a new database connection named `db` and linking it to our existing, pre-populated database file, `movies.json`. This connection is our primary object to interact with the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "By executing this cell, you'll have successfully set up your TinyDB environment and connected to the provided database. You're now ready to venture into the world of document databases."

    "# Simple Queries \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "TinyDB allows for simple queries to find records that match certain conditions. The **`Query()`** function in TinyDB is like a helper that allows you to create these searches for your database. When you call **`Query()`**, it gives you an object that you can use to look for particular pieces of information. For example, you could set it up to look for all movies released in the year 2000. You can even combine different search criteria together, like finding all \"Science Fiction\" movies released after 1990. It's your go-to tool for creating searches that are as simple or as detailed as you need.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To find all films released in the year 2000, you would execute the following example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Film = Query()\n",
    "db.search(Film.year == 2000)\n",

    "Adding new records to your TinyDB database is straightforward. You'll create a Python dictionary containing all the information for the new movie, and then you'll use the **`insert()`** method to add that dictionary to your database. The keys of the dictionary should match the field names in your existing records.\n",

    "Let's say you have a database containing information about cars, and you want to add a new car to this collection. Each record in your \"Car\" database might contain fields like make, model, year, color, and mileage.\n",
