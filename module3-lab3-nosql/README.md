# Workshop: Exploring Document Databases with TinyDB

Welcome to the Exploring Document Databases Workshop! In this session, you'll dive into the world of NoSQL databases by exploring TinyDB, a simple document-oriented database. The workshop provides a hands-on experience, allowing you to work with a pre-existing movie dataset to understand how to perform basic operations and queries.

## Overview

The workshop aims to equip participants with the fundamentals of working with document databases, using TinyDB as an example platform. As a lightweight, file-based embedded database, TinyDB offers the benefits of quick setup and ease of use, making it perfect for educational purposes. While not as robust or scalable as other NoSQL databases like MongoDB, it's a great starting point to understand document database interactions.

### Why TinyDB?

1. **Ease of Setup**: As an embedded database, TinyDB doesn't require a separate server setup. This is particularly advantageous for workshops where students may not have administrative access to install software.

2. **Learning Experience**: Using TinyDB will give you a taste of what it's like to work with document databases, albeit at a smaller scale, and without the complexities of server management.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed
- Jupyter Notebook
- Basic knowledge of Python programming

### Installation

1. Clone the workshop repository to your local machine.

    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:georgetown-analytics/module3-lab3-nosql.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the workshop directory and launch Jupyter Notebook:

    ```bash
    cd module3-lab3-nosql
    jupyter notebook
    ```

3. Open the `workshop.ipynb` notebook to begin the assignment.

## Your Task

You will be provided with a Jupyter notebook containing partially completed code and tasks. Your job is to fill in the missing parts. Use the provided docstring and comments to guide your implementation. Note that some cells contain code that's ready to execute, so you only need to run those cells.

## Submission Instructions

After you complete the lab, upload your Jupyter notebook (`workshop.ipynb`) to the assignment page in Canvas.
