# Technology Demonstration Lab: MovieLens Data Analysis with Pandas

Welcome to the "MovieLens Data Analysis with Pandas" demonstration Lab!

## Overview

This lab is designed to demonstrate essential analysis skills using the `pandas` library. The included notebook will process the data files and perform different analyses of the MovieLens dataset.  

The MovieLens dataset is a collection of movie ratings data compiled by the GroupLens Research Project at the University of Minnesota. It contains user-generated movie ratings, and often includes additional information such as movie metadata (genres, titles, release dates) and user demographics. The dataset is widely used in recommendation systems research to develop and test collaborative filtering algorithms, which aim to predict users' ratings on movies based on the preferences of similar users. The dataset is publicly available in several versions, ranging from small subsets suitable for initial development and testing, to larger versions with millions of ratings for more comprehensive research.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed
- Jupyter Notebook
- Basic knowledge of Python programming

### Installation

1. Clone the workshop repository to your local machine.

    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:georgetown-analytics/module4-lab4-pandas.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the workshop directory and launch Jupyter Notebook:

    ```bash
    cd module4-lab4-pandas
    jupyter notebook
    ```

3. Open the `workshop.ipynb` notebook to begin the assignment.

## Your Task

Your task is to execute the Jupyter notebook cell by cell, carefully observing how pandas functions and methods are applied to the MovieLens dataset to address specific questions. 

There's no need to write any code; simply run each cell and review the outputs to understand the data transformation processes being demonstrated. 

## Submission Instructions

After you complete the lab, save the notebook with the output viewable from executing each cell, then upload your Jupyter notebook (`workshop.ipynb`) to the assignment page in Canvas.
