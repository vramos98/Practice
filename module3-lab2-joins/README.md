# Workshop: Heroic Joins with SQL

Welcome to the Heroic Joins with SQL Workshop! This hands-on session will guide you through the Marvel Superhero Universe using SQL `JOINS` in SQLite. You'll get to connect, query, and explore a database to better understand the relationships within it.

## Overview

This workshop is designed to provide a practical understanding of SQL `JOINS` using SQLite as the database engine. By exploring the Marvel Superhero Universe, participants will gain insights into how to combine information from multiple tables effectively.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed
- Jupyter Notebook
- Basic knowledge of Python programming and SQL Joins

### Installation

1. Clone the workshop repository to your local machine.

    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:georgetown-analytics/module3-lab2-joins.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the workshop directory and launch Jupyter Notebook:

    ```bash
    cd module3-lab2-joins
    jupyter notebook
    ```

3. Open the `workshop.ipynb` notebook to begin the assignment.

## Your Task

Work through the Jupyter notebook by filling in the missing code as needed.

Use the provided docstring and c`omments to guide your implementation. Keep in mind that some cells already have code and you only need to execute those cells.

## Submission Instructions

After you complete the lab, upload your Jupyter notebook (`workshop.ipynb`) to the assignment page in Canvas.
