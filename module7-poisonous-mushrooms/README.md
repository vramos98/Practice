# Poisonous Mushrooms

Welcome to the Poisonous Mushrooms Lab.

## Overview

This lab will demonstrate how you can use visual steering for a classification task where you are responsible for choosing the model that will do the best job in identifying poisonous mushrooms.  

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed
- Jupyter Notebook
- Basic knowledge of Python programming

### Installation

1. Clone the workshop repository to your local machine.

    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:georgetown-analytics/module7-poisonous-mushrooms.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the workshop directory and launch Jupyter Notebook:

    ```bash
    cd module7-poisonous-mushrooms
    jupyter notebook
    ```

3. Install all the packages listed in `requirements.txt`.  Note that these are requirements for all of the labs in this module.

4. Open the `poisonous_mushrooms.ipynb` notebook to begin the assignment.

## Your Task

Go through the notebook and execute all the cells and observe the output to get an understanding of how the different models perform on the dataset.  Answer the reflection questions at the end.
